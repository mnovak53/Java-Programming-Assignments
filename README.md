# Java Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of my Java assignments and practice projects.  
Each folder contains a small program or data structure that demonstrates core programming concepts in Java.

## Projects

### GeneratingEmail
A small Java program that creates and formats email addresses from given inputs.  
**Concepts:** string handling, basic Java I/O.  

---

### HashTable
Implementation of a hash table data structure in Java.  
**Concepts:** hashing, collisions, key-value storage.  

---

### LinkedSpecialQueue
A linked-list based queue with a twist: numbers between 10–65 are treated as *special* and inserted at the front.  
**Concepts:** linked lists, queues, custom insertion rules.  

---

### Monitor
Driver program that combines `Student`, `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Course` classes.  
Prints student info, circle radius, rectangle area, and average GPA.  
**Concepts:** OOP, ArrayLists, class interaction.  

---

### NewStackInterface
Custom stack interface extending the classic stack with extra methods:  
`popFromBottom`, `bottom`, `size`, plus the usual push/pop.  
**Concepts:** abstract data types, interfaces.  

---

### OOPInJava
Basic OOP exercises with inheritance and method overriding (e.g., `Person` and `Doctor`).  
**Concepts:** classes, inheritance, constructors, overriding.  

---

### bubblesort
Java implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.  
**Concepts:** sorting, arrays, loops.  

---

## Purpose
These projects reflect my early practice in Java.  
They’re not production-ready, but they show my work with:
- Core data structures (queues, stacks, hash tables)  
- Object-oriented programming (inheritance, classes, interfaces)  
- Algorithms (sorting)  
- Small applications

## Note
For my larger and more polished projects, check my other repositories.  
This repo is mainly for learning, experimenting, and showing my growth as a developer.
